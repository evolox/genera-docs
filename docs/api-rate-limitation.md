# API Rate Limitation

The API provided by Genera is subject to rate limitation to ensure fair usage and maintain optimal performance for all consumers. This documentation outlines the rate limitation policy.

## Maximum Requests Per Second
The rate limitation policy allows each customer to configure their own maximum request rate limit. Customers can specify the desired rate limit based on their individual usage patterns and requirements.

## Identification
Each API consumer is uniquely identified by an API key or access token. The rate limitation is enforced per consumer based on this identification. It ensures that each consumer is held accountable for their request rate and prevents any single consumer from monopolizing system resources.

## Configuration Options
Customers have the flexibility to configure their rate limit through the API management dashboard or via API calls. They can specify the maximum number of requests allowed per second for their API key or access token.

## Dynamic Adjustments
Customers can dynamically adjust their rate limit as needed to accommodate changes in usage patterns or business requirements. The rate limit can be increased or decreased at any time, providing customers with the flexibility to scale their usage of the API services.

## Identification
Each customer is uniquely identified by their API key. The rate limitation is enforced per customer based on this identification. It ensures that each customer can define and manage their own rate limit independently.

## Throttling
If a customer exceeds their configured rate limit, subsequent requests will be throttled or delayed until the request rate falls below the defined threshold. Throttling helps to regulate the flow of requests and prevent overload on the API servers.

## Impact and Considerations

**Pricing Implications**: Please note that the rate limit chosen by the customer will affect pricing. Higher rate limits may result in increased costs, while lower rate limits may offer cost savings.

**Customized Usage**: The customizable rate limitation policy allows customers to tailor their request rate limit according to their specific needs and usage patterns.

**Optimal Performance**: By allowing customers to set their own rate limit, the API service can maintain optimal performance and responsiveness for each individual customer.

**Compliance**: Customers are responsible for configuring and adhering to their chosen rate limit. Failure to comply may result in temporary or permanent suspension of access to the API services.

**Conclusion**:
The customizable rate limitation policy outlined in this documentation empowers customers to define their own request rate limit for the API provided by Genera. Customers can configure their rate limit to suit their individual usage requirements and ensure optimal performance. If you have any questions or need assistance with configuring your rate limit, please contact the API support team for guidance.
